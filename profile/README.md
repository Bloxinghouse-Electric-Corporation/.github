## Covebay NGS
Covebay is a fictional 4th generation [BWR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor) type nuclear power plant with a rated capacity of 2800 MWe.

It was comissioned in the late 80' and upgraded in the early 2000'.

With an operating Thermal power of 3000 MWt and rated steam pressure of 75 Bar at 390 C, this is a modernized BWR haven.

## Dunscom NPP
Dunscom is a fictional nuclear plant located near Lowville, NY.

It is based on a Westinghouse 4-loop [PWR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_water_reactor) commissioned in 1975 using plants like Diablo Canyon, Watts Bar and Sequoyah as reference with the aim to be as realistic as possible.
